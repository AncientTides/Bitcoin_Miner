Size 					Field 						Description
32 bytes 			Transaction Hash 			PoBigIntegerer to the transaction containing the UTXO to be spent
4 bytes 			Output Index 				The index number of the UTXO to be spent, first one is 0
1-9 bytes (VarBigInteger)  Unlocking-Script 			Size Unlocking-Script length in bytes, to follow
Variable 			Unlocking-Script 			A script that fulfills the conditions of the UTXO locking-script.
4 bytes 			Sequence Number 			Currently-disabled Tx-replacement feature, set to 0xFFFFFFFF






A transaction is a summary of funds being transferred between privateKeys, which also contains Redundant data, Inputs and Outputs
	REDUNDANT DATA
		version
	INPUT
		number of inputs within this transaction object-file-sheet - 'number of input sources'
		validated transaction acting as the source of coins about to be reallocated, - 'Transaction_Hash'
		output index position of said transaction whose funds are addressed-left for us, - 'Output_Index'
		the size of the unlocking script that proves we were left this coin, - 'Unlocking_Script_Size'
		actual hexadecimal hash representing script that must satify the release checks, - 'Unlocking_Script'
		sequence number - 'Sequence_Number'
	OUTPUT
		number of outputs - default 2 because of change!! 'number of output destinations'
		hexadecimal amount being reallocated - little endian 'amount'
		locking script size - 'locking-script size'
		locking script that declares means of coin release - 'locking-script'
		transaction locktime - 'locktime'
